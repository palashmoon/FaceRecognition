# Introduction
Age and gender, two of the key facial attributes, play a very foundational role in social interactions, making age and gender estimation from a single face image an important task in intelligent applications, such as access control, human-computer interaction, law enforcement, marketing intelligence
and visual surveillance, etc.

# Requirement
pip install OpenCV-python

# Steps to Follow
1. Face detection with Haar cascades
2. Gender Recognition with CNN
3. Age Recognition with 

# 1. Face detection with Haar cascades
This is a part most of us at least have heard of. OpenCV/JavaCV provide direct methods to import Haar-cascades and use them to detect faces. I will not be explaining this part in deep. You guys can refer to my previous article to know more about face detection using OpenCV.
